You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say Besides some comment on the weather  Well in case you failed to notice, In case you failed to see, This is my heart bleeding before you, This is me down on my knees  And these foolish games are tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart You're breaking my heart  You're always brilliant in the morning, Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar  You'd teach me of honest things, Things that were daring, things that were clean Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean I hid my soiled hands behind my back Somewhere along the line, I must have gone off track with you  Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else, Somebody who gave a damn, Somebody more like myself  And these foolish games are tearing me, Your tearing me, your tearing me apart And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart You're breaking my heart.  And you took your coat off, stood in the rain, You're always crazy like that"
